[What is a .env file?
A .env file or dotenv file is a simple text configuration file for controlling your Applications environment constants. 
Between Local, Staging and Production environments, the majority of your Application will not change.
However in many Applications there are instances in which some configuration will need to be altered between environments. Common configuration changes between environments may include, but not limited to, URL's and API keys.
What do .env files look like?
.env files are line delimitated text files, meaning that each new line represents a single variable. 
By convention .env variable names are uppercase words separated by underscores. 
Variable names are followed directly by an = which, in turn is followed directly by the value, for example: ]
